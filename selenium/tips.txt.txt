ELEMENT NOT FOUND

This type of error may indicate a timing problem, i.e., the element specified by a locator in your command wasn’t 
fully loaded when the command was executed. 
Try putting a pause 5000 before the command to determine whether the problem is indeed related to timing. 
If so, investigate using an appropriate waitFor* or *AndWait command before the failing command.

selenium.waitForPageToLoad("30000");
